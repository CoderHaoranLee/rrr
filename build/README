ASSUMPTIONS and RESTRICTIONS

Please read this carefully if you want to run your own examples with this code

- The code has only been tested for EDGE_SE2 and VERTEX_SE2 types at the moment.
- If there is an edge between two vertices :
    	- It is loop closure if starting edge id > ending edge id (loops close from future nodes to past nodes)
    	- Odometry link otherwise.
- Currently only runs in batch mode and expects to read a g2o file from the system


Running the code 

The example code expects three arguments\
	- name of the g2o file to read
	- Odometry Rate (in Hertz)
	- Loop Closure rate ( in Hertz )
	
The code generates 3 g2o files that can be viewed with the g2o_viewer application that comes with g2o 

    1. out_accept.g2o [Contains only Loop Closing links that are correct + Odometry links]
    2. out_reject.g2o [Contains rejected loop Closing links + odometry ]
    3. out_opt.g2o    [optimized graph of 1.]
